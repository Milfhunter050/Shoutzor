The Shoutzor Module - Requires the Shoutzor Theme to function as intended.

Shoutzor is a system designed to have music playing at events like a LAN-Party.
Comes with an AutoDJ when no music is requested to ensure music keeps playing.

Shoutzor (optionally) uses [echoprint-codegen](https://github.com/echonest/echoprint-codegen) and [echoprint-server](https://github.com/echonest/echoprint-server) for music fingerprinting to prevent double uploads.<br />
Follow the instructions on [this page](http://echoprint.me/start) and the [github readme](https://github.com/echonest/echoprint-codegen) as for how to install echoprint-codegen on your server, then set the correct path in the shoutzor settings.

Also make sure to install the `text2wave` (from Festival) and `swh-plugins` package BEFORE installing the `liquidsoap` and `liquidsoap-plugin-all` packages, this due to requirements in some of the plugins for liquidsoap.
